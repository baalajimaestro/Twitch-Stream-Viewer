# Twitch Stream Viewer

This is currently targeted at **Valorant Drops Enabled** streams, Valorant is in closed beta, as of writing this. It can be obtained by watching __Drops Enabled__ twitch streams. But what if you cant watch them?

Then, my tool comes to rescue!

- Just install `xvfb and google-chrome` from your favourite package manager.

- Run `pip install selenium xvfbwrapper`

- Run the associated python file, twitch.py, boom!
